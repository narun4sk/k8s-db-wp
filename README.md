## Running Wordpress App and HA MySQL Cluster on Kubernetes

This exercise is based on `k3d` - a lightweight wrapper to run `k3s` (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. For the flawless experience it's recommended to install `k3d` according to the official guidelines: https://k3d.io/v5.2.0/#installation

### Bootstrap Kubernetes cluster

In this step you will deploy 3x workers (2 labeled `role: db`, 1 labeled `role: app`) and 1x control plane server. Ingress will be exposed on the `8081` TCP port on the host PC. Additionally `k3d_cluster.sh` script will create `./mysql-data` directory for storing MySQL PersistentVolume data.

```
$ ./k3d_cluster.sh my-k8s
mkdir: created directory '/home/tst/k8s-db-wp/mysql-data'
mkdir: created directory '/home/tst/k8s-db-wp/mysql-data/data-0'
mkdir: created directory '/home/tst/k8s-db-wp/mysql-data/data-1'

### Set up base variables

Modify `./env_vars.sh` as required:
```
export DB_USER=db_user
export DB_PASS=db_random_pass
export DB_NAME=wordpress
export DB_NAMESPACE=mysql
export DB_DEPLOYMENT=mysql-cluster
export WP_USER=wp_user
export WP_PASS=wp_random_pass
export WP_NAMESPACE=wordpress
export WP_DEPLOYMENT=wordpress
```

### Inspect deployment manifests

```
$ ./mysql.sh template
....

$ ./wordpress.sh template
....
```

### Deploy MySQL Cluster

```
$ ./mysql.sh
NAME: mysql-cluster
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Dec  5 12:17:57 2021
NAMESPACE: mysql
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

### Deploy Wordpress

```
$ ./wordpress.sh
NAME: wordpress
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Dec  5 12:23:03 2021
NAMESPACE: wordpress
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
CHART NAME: wordpress
CHART VERSION: 12.2.3
APP VERSION: 5.8.2
....
```

### Validate deployment

You may validate the deployment by opening the browser and navigating it to the http://localhost:8081

### Remove Kubernetes cluster

Once you're done with testing you may delete k8s cluster created in the first step:

```
k3d cluster delete my-k8s
```
